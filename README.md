![my Currency Converter](https://github.com/RAFALZDROWOK/currency-converter-react/blob/master/public/Currency%20converter.png?raw=true)
## Demo
https://rafalzdrowok.github.io/currency-converter-react/
## Description:
The purpose of creating the "currency-converter-react" was:
- getting practice in REACT.JS
- writing the code in REACT.JS, which I wrote earlier in pure JS
- gaining practice in CSS implementation in REACT.JS
- introducing the version to the deployment
- introduction of UseState Hook - UseState allows me to enter and update values from input and select, to my "result" function
- introduction of UseEffect Hook - UseEffect allows me enter and update current date and time
- entering the date and time in real time via the New Date() object
- using Styled-components instead of the previously used CSS
- introduction of GlobalStyle - GlobalStyle allows me to apply master styles that apply to the entire application
- introduction of ThemeProvider - ThemeProvider allows me to introduce and modify selected styles in all React components from one "theme" object
- use of new technologies such as:
React✔ ReactDOM✔ Webpack✔ Babel✔ ESLint✔ Jest✔ PostCSS✔ HTML✔ CSS✔ JavaScript✔ ES6+✔ BEM✔ GIT✔ Flex✔ Grid✔ Media queries✔ Immutability✔ Arrays✔ UseState✔ UseEffect✔ New Date()✔ Styled-components✔ GlobalStyle✔ ThemeProvider✔ 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
